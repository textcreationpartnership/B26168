            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS I lately Recommended to your Care the strict Execution of the Laws for the due Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the LORD's-DAY; Wherein, if You and the rest of my Brethren the <hi>Aldermen</hi> shall do your parts within your respective Wards, I question not but it will have the desired effect, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent (at least) the open Profanation of that Day, I therefore again press you to employ your Care in that particular. But because there are also Notoriously in practice within this City other great Vices and Disorders, very dishonourable to Almighty GOD, and scandalous to the Cities Government, (such as Drunkenness, Common Swearing and Cursing, Tipling and Gaming;) I have thought fit, by the Advice of my Brethren the <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> to recommend to you likewise the suppressing of those Enormities (as far as in You lies) within Your Ward. And in regard there is grown to much in use a most Dissolute and Infamous Practice, for Men and Women in the Evening to wander about the Streets and Impudently sollicit others to Wickedness; Your Care is earnestly desired, That the several Constables of Your Ward may frequently in the Evening Walk the Streets within their Precincts, and be Industrious to prevent that Lewd and Shameful Practice, and Apprehend all Persons they shall observe to Misbehave themselves in that kind, or shall have just cause to suspect, and bring them before Me or some other Justice of the Peace, to be sent to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> bound to the Good Behaviour, or otherwise dealt with according to Law.</p>
            <p>And for the other Misdemeanors before-mentioned, That the Constables and other Officers may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their Duties, and the Penalties by Law appointed to be inflicted on Offenders may be the better known, I have caused a short Abstract to be made thereof out of the Laws, and to be here set down; That is to say.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Drunkenness.</note>Every Person that shall be Drunk, and thereof Convicted by View of a Justice of Peace, or one Witnesses Oath, or the parties Confession, shall forfeit <hi>Five Shillings,</hi> to be paid within a Week to the Churchwardens of the Parish for the use of the Poor, or else to be levied by Distress, by Warrant from a Justice of Peace; If the party be not able, He is to be committed to the Stocks for six Hours: And for the second Offence, He's to be bound to the Good Behaviour. Every Constable or other, neglecting his Duty, in correcting the Offender or levying the Penalty, to forfeit <hi>Ten Shillings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Swearing and Cursing.</note>The Person guilty thereof in the hearing of a Justice of Peace, or proved by Two Witnesses or the parties Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, shall for every Offence pay <hi>Twelve Pence</hi> to the Poor, to be levied by Distress, as before. For want of Distress, the Offender (if above 12 Years old) to sit in the Stocks Three Hours; If under Twelve, to be Whipped by Warrant of the Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Tipling.</note>No Person is to continue Tipling in any Tavern or other Victualling-House (other than Labouring and Handicrafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon the usual Working-days for one hour at Dinner-time, and unless for urgent occasions to be allowed by two Justices of the Peace) on pain of Forfeiting <hi>Three Shillings Four Pence,</hi> and <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> by the Victualler or House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, that shall permit such Tipling in his House: The party being convicted thereof by View of a Justice of Peace or One Witnesses Oath, or the parties own Confession; the same to be levied by Distress, by a Constable or the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens of the Parish where the Offence is committed, and to go to the Poor of the said Parish.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gaming.</note>All Persons keeping Common Gaming-Houses and Gamesters commonly resorting thereunto, are to find Sureties or be committed.</p>
            <p>For the suppressing of all which Disorders and Punishment of the Offenders, You are strictly to Injoyn all the Constables and Churchwardens within your Ward, That they carefully and constantly perform their Duties therein: And that You often Remind them thereof; and such as you shall find Remiss, that You take Care they may undergo the Penalties to be inflicted in that behalf. Hereof fail not, as You tender the Weal and Prosperity of this City.</p>
